# AIR-QUALITY-MEASUREMENT-SYSTEM
Air pollution has been consistently ranked by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and its Science Advisory Board to be among the top five environmental public health risks. Average person spends an estimated 90% of their time indoors so that poor indoor air quality (IAQ) poses a substantial risk to public health. Poor air quality may cause increased short-term health problems such as fatigue and nausea as well as chronic respiratory diseases, heart disease, and lung cancer. This project proposes an air pollution monitoring system. The system was developed using the Arduino microcontroller. The air pollution monitoring system was designed to monitor and analyse air quality in real-time and log data to a remote server, keeping the data updated over the internet. Air quality measurements were taken based on the Parts per Million (PPM) metrics. The result was displayed on the designed hardwareâ€™s display interface and could be accessed via the cloud on any smart mobile device.
